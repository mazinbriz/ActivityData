## Included files
```
CodeBook.md		    Description of the variables, the data and the transformations to create the tidied activity data set
tidydata.txt      Output from the run_analysis.r, this is the tidied data set transformed from the original input files
run_analysis.r		Script to create a single tidy data set from the UCI data files
readme.md         (this file)

## Input files
```
ActivityData.txt	 Human activity recognition data from smartphones transformed to meet the principles for tidy data
features_info.txt   Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
features.txt        List of all features.
activity_labels.txt Links the class labels with their activity name.

## Notes:
This project was completed as part of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course September 2015. The script and output data file have been developed to practice the principles for tidy data as described by Hadley's paper (which may be accessible from http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
